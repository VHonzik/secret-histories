# Secret Histories version X.Y

Thanks for downloading Secret Histories! Please get in touch if end up playing, I want to hear all about it.

## Contents

- `README.pdf` - This file
- `Rules.pdf` - PDF with game rules
- `SecretHistories.pdf` - PDF with all of the game cards
- `Tokens/` - Assets for tokens

## Instructions

1) Print SecretHistories.pdf, I strongly recommend in color, and do a little bit of crafting to cut out the individual cards. "Perhaps [the Forge of Days](https://cultistsimulator.fandom.com/wiki/The_Forge_of_Days) Hour will notice you ðŸ˜‰". There is `1px` spacing between the cards. The cards are designed to fit in `60mmx90mm` sleeves.

2) Print Rules.pdf or keep it around digitally.

3) Finally, the game uses various tokens in addition to cards. I haven't figured out a great way to manufacture these yet. I would recommend borrowing cubes or paper tokens from other board games. One of the tokens is the game currency "funds". These in particular should be easy to find in your collection, any currency representation with single digit scale will do. You will need following tokens types and amounts. Art for them can be found in `Tokens` folder if you are feeling crafty.
